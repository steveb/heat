# this file lists all the dependencies needed for running heat

# The greenlet package must be compiled with gcc and needs
# the Python.h headers. Make sure you install the python-dev
# package to get the right headers...

# lxml note: You will need gcc buildtools installed and must
# have installed libxml headers for lxml to be successfully
# installed using pip, therefore you will need to install the
# libxml2-dev(el) and libxslt-dev(el) packages.
